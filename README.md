# AI German Translator

I have used HuggingFace and Gradio to help this project come alive. If you would like to run it on your local machine, create a folder on your machine, and add a file with the name 'app.py'. We will edit this file after a few steps.

## Step 1: Download the dependencies.

Download the following dependencies:

### Dependencies

Before using the AI German Translator, make sure to install the following dependencies:

- [Gradio](https://pypi.org/project/gradio/): Gradio is a Python library that lets you quickly create customizable UI components around your machine learning models. Install it using:
  
  ```pip install gradio```

- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/): Transformers is a popular library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, developed by Hugging Face. It provides state-of-the-art pre-trained models for various NLP tasks. Install it using:
  
  ```pip install transformers```

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): TensorFlow is a powerful machine learning library developed by Google. It's used for building and training deep learning models. Install it using:
  
  ```pip install tensorflow```

- [tf-keras](https://pypi.org/project/tf-keras/): tf-keras is a TensorFlow-compatible implementation of the Keras API, which provides an easy-to-use interface for building and training neural networks. Install it using:
  
  ```pip install tf-keras```

## Step 2: Edit the 'app.py' file.

Copy and paste the code in the app.py file on this GitHub Repo

## Step 3: Running the build.

After following these steps, a server on your local machine would start as well as a live link (which expires after 72 hours). 

Click on the local link on your terminal to access the running server on your local machine to test out the creation.

Share the link below the local link with your friends and impress them with the creation!
